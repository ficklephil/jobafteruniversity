When I was a graduate I had no idea of whether I would get a job or not when I came out 
of university. This website will give you some useful information about :
-If the job market for a career will have increased by the time your out of uni.
-what competition you face
-if you will be able to support yourself finacially from the degree you take,
& if you will be able to put enough money aside to put down a deposit on a house
or a flat when you come out of uni.

All of which things that I had to think about when doing a degree.

This website will help you make an informed choice on the career which you may
undertake and the learning options you choose to get there. But at the end of the day
you maybe passionate about an area, therefore we give you more career options incase that 
career is in decline while your at university.

Enpower yourself with the knowledge!
